                    <p> PhotographyÂ is the process of creating still or moving pictures by recording radiation on a sensitive medium like film or an electronic sensor.
        The products of photography are called negatives and photographs, the latter being developed
        from the negatives. Light patterns reflected or emitted by objects activate a sensitive chemical 
        or electronic sensor during a timed exposure usually through a photographic lens in a camera.
        The camera stores the resulting information chemically or electronically.
